2️⃣ Work-Life Balance is lowest in IT, R&D & Finance departments

Departments like Operations, Finance, R&D, and IT show lower Work-Life Balance scores (~2.4–2.6).

These departments might have heavier workloads, inconsistent shifts, or high-pressure roles.

3️⃣ Male–Female distribution is almost equal, but HR & Operations have fewer employees
